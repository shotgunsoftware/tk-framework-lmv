The Shotgun LMV Framework
==================================================

The Shotgun LMV Framework contains a collection of helpers and tools to make it easy and
painless to translate files to LMV. This file format can next be read by the Autodesk
viewers and more precisely by the Shotgun 3D Viewer. For now, it contains only one module
which allows users to convert Alias and VRED files to LMV format.

.. warning::
    For now, only these file formats are compatible with the LMV translation:
        * .wire
        * .igs
        * .CATPart
        * .stp
        * .jt
        * .fbx
        * .vpb
